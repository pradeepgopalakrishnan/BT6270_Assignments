The HHmodel_solution.m takes the current as a command line argument. The snippet of code to count valid peaks according to the threshold has been added to the preexisting model implementation. HHmodel_solution.m can be called as "octave HHmodel_solution.m 0.4".
The script run.sh executes the HHmodel_solution.m with a sequence of current values as set. Can be run as "./run.sh". The output of run.sh can be redirected to a file data.txt using "./run.sh > data.txt". 
data.txt contains current and average frequency in consecutive lines for mulitple instances of injected current values.
The python snippet takes in the data.txt file from its working directory and returns the plot between I2 and I3.
